# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Zoo Project
An application for storing information about train passengers. Ensure proper memory management, code encapsulation, and implemention the following functionality:

1. **Animal Species Classes:**
   - Created classes representing various animal species, such as Giraffes, Elephants, Lions, and Monkeys.
   - Each class inherits from the abstract class Animals, with a method for printing or returning the species name.

2. **Wagon Class:**
   - Implemented a Carriage class that stores information about the number of a particular animal species in a given wagon.
   - Utilized the classes created for different animal species.

3. **Train Class:**
   - Developed a Train class that holds data about the set of attached wagons.

4. **Train Class Operations:**
   - Defined the appropriate operator in the Train class to enable attaching a wagon to the train.
   - Implemented the unhook method in the Train class, allowing the detachment of a selected wagon.
   - Introduced the show method in the Train class, facilitating the printing of wagon contents according to the pattern: [giraffes, 3]<->[elephants, 2]<->[lions, 1]<->[monkeys, 5]<->

5. **Testing:**
   - Wrote comprehensive test code to validate the functionality of all implemented class components.

6. **Copy Constructor:**
   - Implemented a copy constructor for the Train class, enhancing the program's functionality.

7. **Additional Testing:**
   - Conducted further test code to verify the correctness of the copy constructor and other functionalities.
